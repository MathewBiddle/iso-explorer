<p><em>A TypeName is a LocalName that references either a recordType or object type in some form of schema. The stored value “aName” is the returned value for the “aName()” operation. This is the types name. - For parsing from types (or objects) the parsible name normally uses a “.” navigation separator, so that it is of the form [class].[member].[memberOfMember]. …)</em></p>
