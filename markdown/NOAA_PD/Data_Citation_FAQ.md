My data is archived at a different facility than NOAA, but they are not minting DOIs. Can I use the NOAA EZID license?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You must request a NOAA data center to also archive the resource.

What if my data are divided and sent to two different archives?
---------------------------------------------------------------

It’s ok to split datasets and have more domain specific DOIs assigned. (to do: add example)

Why do we have DOIs when we have metadata?
------------------------------------------

DOIs are recognized by journals and they are permanent.

Can I use the same DOI after I clean up the data or provide new updates?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, in most cases. However, it depends on how significant the changes are. We recommend **major** versions of the same dataset be given new identifiers and treated as separate datasets, with links back to the prior version kept in the metadata describing that dataset. Forward links to new versions from the original are easily accomplished via a metadata search on the unique global identifier.

Determination of major or minor changes remains at the discretion of the Data Centers in consultation with the creators or providers.

See [ESIP Guidance](http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/Interagency_Data_Stewardship/Citations/provider_guidelines#Note_on_Versioning_and_Locators)

How will you maintain the information associated with the DOI?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Update the metadata content (data centers do this already) and update the landing page link – if url changes.

Can I obtain a DOI for data that is not archived?
-------------------------------------------------

No, only archived data are eligible for a NOAA DOI.

Are you handling the **version** between sub-parts of the collections?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Include major.minor version in the recommended citation and describe when you accessed the resource.
