### Creating a Sample XML File

Here's a fast and easy way to create a sample XML file. It can be used as a reference when editing metadata.

1.  From the Tools menu, select Generate Sample XML Files...
2.  Click on the Load Settings button and open the above file.
3.  Change the Output Folder to one on your desktop, click OK.

-   These are example settings, and trying out different ones might be necessary to accomplish your goal.
    -   For example, you could change the preferred number of repetitions to 2 so that every repeatable object in the standard is shown twice in your sample file.
