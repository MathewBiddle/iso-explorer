### How to add “template” text

Oxygen has a feature for adding template text that you need to include often in your xml files. I think this is useful for the quickly adding the codelist urls.

You can manually enter the values or you can import an xml file that describes the values you want. After you have set your template values you can quickly add them as needed while you are editing a metadata record by selecting *ctrl+shift+space* and then select your value from the drop down menu that appears.
