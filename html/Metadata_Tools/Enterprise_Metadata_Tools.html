<p>This is a collection of tools that operate on XML files stored in a filesystem or web accessible directory. The tools include translation, validation, reporting and resolving services. Record Service tools operate on a single XML record, whereas Collection Service tools operate on a collection of records contained in a web accessible folder (WAF).</p>
<h2 id="record-services">Record Services</h2>
<p>These services operate on an XML record accessible from a local filesystem or URL. To access an XML record, select the File radio button and browse to the record on your local filesystem, or select the Url radio button and paste a URL into URL text field. To apply a service select a Service Type and click the submit button.</p>

<tr class="odd">
<td>Well Formed</td>
<td>This service checks the structure of the XML to ensure it is well formed. Well formed XML is required for XML processors and browsers to read the file. An error will be returned if the XML is not well formed.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Resolve XML</td>
<td>This service resolves an unprocessed XML record. An unprocessed XML record may contain xlink references to XML content stored at an external location. The resolve process replaces the xlink references in the unprocessed record with the external XML content being references by the xlink. The externally referenced content is called a <a href="https://geo-ide.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php?title=ISO_Components">component</a>.</td>

<td>Link Check</td>
<td>This service checks URL references within ISO CI_OnlineResource elements to ensure the links are valid. If a link is broken an error message is returned.</td>

<tr class="even">
<td>ISO Validate</td>
<td>This service validates ISO metadata records with the ISO 19139 schema. This validation ensures the XML record complies with the structure and rules defined in the ISO 19139 schema.</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>Schematron</td>
<td>This service validates ISO metadata records with Schematron. Schematron provides validation checks not possible with XML schema. Schematron enables user defined business rules and custom error messages to be incorporated into the validation. Some examples include checking for empty elements and verifying codelist values are valid.</td>
