<p><a href="https://www.nosc.noaa.gov/EDMC/PD.DMP.php">Download the Data Management Planning PD</a> <strong>Introduction to this PD:</strong> NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 212‚Äê15, Management of Environmental Data and Information, states that environmental data is to be managed based upon a lifecycle that includes developing and following a data management plan. The purpose of this procedural directive is to expand upon this requirement for Data Management Plans (DMPs), direct managers of all data production projects and systems to write data management plans, and provide detailed guidance on who should write them and how to write them. It contains a <a href="https://geo-ide.noaa.gov/wiki/images/0/03/Data_Management_Plan_Template.doc">template</a> with questions to be considered and addressed in planning all data production projects.</p>
<p>The goal of the Data Management plan is to ensure that data are properly collected, documented, made accessible, and preserved for future use in a NOAA Data Center or other longterm archive facility.</p>
<p>Examples of completed Data Management Plans can be found in the <a href="https://geo-ide.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php?title=Category:Data_Management_Plans">NOAA Data Management Plan Repository</a>.</p>
